The date is 4/11/2022, and I am preparing for my first technical interview with an exciting company. JavaScript has been my language of choice (secretly wishing I picked python first,) and I'm preparing using Code Wars. I'll be including my own walk-through's detailing:

    -How I got to the conclusion
    -Where I got the help
    -And Why it works

Enjoy, & wish me look.
